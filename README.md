# CS-120-Final-Project
Book Tracker

This repo holds the code for a book tracker. The website will allow users to do tasks such as track books that they have read, add future books to read, write notes, and rate the books. Additionally, based on the userâ€™s library, we would provide suggestions for books in the same genre. This would be a platform that provides users with information for where they can find access to books (e.g. Amazon Kindle, Audible, Barnes & Noble).
